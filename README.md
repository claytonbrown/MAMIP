- Policy validation using AWS Access Analyzer
- Multiple notification channels
- Tracking of deprecated policies
- Serverless architecture using ECS Fargate (Spot)

## ‚úÖ Policy Validation

Each AWS Managed Policy is automatically validated using [AWS Access Analyzer Policy Validation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/iam-access-analyzer-update-policy-validation/). Validation findings are stored in the [findings folder](./findings/).

## üë¥ Deprecated Policies

The repository maintains a list of [deprecated policies](./DEPRECATED.json) that are no longer actively managed by AWS. Policy validation is only performed on current AWS-managed policies.

## ‚è∞ Schedule

The monitoring service runs on ECS Fargate (Spot) with configurable schedules. Current settings can be found in the [Terraform configuration](https://github.com/z0ph/MAMIP/blob/master/automation/tf-fargate/variables.tf).
